I decided to implement the container form of a vector to make the HForest. I decided to 
build my program by starting with the HTree program and figuring out how to change the 
programs I made from working with a struct to a class, where the members are private. 
This caused me some initial problems but I was eventually able to get all the functions 
working and able to print the values. After I got the HTree class working, I went to work
on the HForest class. The challenge of the HForest class was to implement things for the
vector container and make the functions more container specific. It took a lot of reading 
up on the vector container, the functions associated with it, and also understanding the 
c++ class structure. I originally had some problems with implementing make_heap; however, 
after messing around with the order, I was able to get make_heap to work correctly and 
return the correct values.
